# dotfiles

Bunch of dot files I've been collecting and updating for MacOSX.

# Install

To get this thing working just link the `.bash_profile` to your home
```sh
   ln -sf ~/dotfiles/bash/.bash_profile ~/.bash_profile
   ln -sf ~/dotfiles/bash/.bash_functions ~/.bash_functions
   ln -sf ~/dotfiles/bash/.bash_aliases ~/.bash_aliases
```
