# dotfiles

Bunch of dot files I've been collecting and updating for MacOSX.

# Install

## sh

To get this thing working just link the bash related files to your home
```sh
   ln -sf ~/dotfiles/bash/.bash_profile ~/.bash_profile
   ln -sf ~/dotfiles/bash/.bash_functions ~/.bash_functions
   ln -sf ~/dotfiles/bash/.bash_aliases ~/.bash_aliases

```

# Extras

Install bash completion

	brew install bash-completion
	brew install docker-completion
